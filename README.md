## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install jekyll-attendease


Next, make sure to require it. Add the following file `_plugins/attendease.rb` and content:

``` ruby
require "jekyll-attendease"
```

## Configuration

You will need to configure by editing your `_config.yml`:

``` yaml
#
# Plugin: jekyll-attendease
#
attendease:
  # Required
  api_host: https://your-event-subdomain.attendease.com/
```

### Optional parameters in the `attendease` section:

schedule_path_name          | schedule           | Folder off of the root to put the schedule pages. Setting to blank will disable schedule page generation.
presenters_path_name        | presenters         | Folder off of the root to put the presenters page. Setting to blank will disable presenter page generation.

copy_data                   | false              | If true, the API-provided data gets copied to an 'attendease_data' folder which will be available for consumption by your Javascript

Remember to replace `https://your-event-subdomain.attendease.com/` with your actual event url, or crazy things will happen!

## Usage

Now the event name can easily be used in your site like so:

`{{ site.attendease.data.event_name }}`

We can also use logical expressions like so:

```
{% if site.attendease.data.has_registration %}
  We have registration!
{% endif %}
```

## Magic Attendease Tags

Simply add the auth script tag and the auth action and account tags and our system will know if you logged in or out and will be able to link to your account!

The script tag sets up an AJAX callback to the server to determine if we are online or offline.

`{% attendease_auth_script %}`

This is simple a div with the id `attendease-auth-account`, maybe more in the future. When used with the `attendease_auth_script` tag it will populate with the link to the account of the attendee.

`{% attendease_auth_account %}`

This is simple a div with the id `attendease-auth-action`, maybe more in the future. When used with the `attendease_auth_script` tag it will populate with a `login` or `logout` action.

`{% attendease_auth_action %}`

This script tag sets up AJAX actions for scheduling sessions.

`{% attendease_scheduler_script %}`

This script tag sets up lingo so your event can sound like you want it to sound like.

`{% attendease_locales_script %}`

A quick way to use our lingo stuff in our jekyll templates.

`{% attendease_t %}`

Output the supporting code to load in the Attendease CMS block renderer.

`{% attendease_block_renderer %}`

You can pass in an optional URL to override where the bundle is found:

`{% attendease_block_renderer https://foobar.cdn/blockrenderer-latest.js %}`

## Listening for the auth callback

In your site's Javascript, do something like this:

``` javascript
JekyllAttendease.onLoginCheck(function(e)
{
  if (e.data.loggedin)
  {
    // do some cool stuff!
    var account = e.data.account;
    // console.log(account);
  }

  // And we have some URLs for you!
  // e.data.loginURL
  // e.data.logoutURL
  // e.data.accountURL
});
```

## Static Schedule Pages

In your `_config.yml` if you add the `generate_schedule_pages` set to `true` under `attendease` it will generate static schedule pages from the Attendease public API.

You can customize the look/structure of each page as well as widgets within the pages. These pages will be automatically generated for you when you build your site.

For Session Day pages:

- `_layouts/attendease_schedule_day_sessions.html` - The layout for the generate session day page. It will list all instances on that day
- `_includes/attendease/session_instance_item.html` - The instance item on the page
- `_includes/attendease/filter.html` - A filter and its items in the instance
- `_includes/attendease/presenter_item.html` - A presenter item in the instance

## Available Data

Using the `site.attendease` structure, you can access the following datasets:
